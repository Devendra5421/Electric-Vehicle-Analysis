# AtliQ Motors 

AtliQ Motors is a leading automotive giant based in the USA, specializing in the production of electric vehicles (EVs). Over the past five years, the company has significantly increased its market share in North America, capturing 25% of the electric and hybrid vehicle segment. This growth has positioned AtliQ Motors as a formidable player in the EV industry.

Recognizing the potential for further growth, AtliQ Motors is now looking to expand its operations into the Indian market. Despite its success in North America, the company's market share in India is currently below 2%. To successfully launch their bestselling models in India, the company needed a thorough understanding of the existing EV/Hybrid market.

Bruce Haryali, the Chief of AtliQ Motors India, was tasked with overseeing this expansion. To ensure a data-driven approach, Bruce commissioned a detailed market study to gather critical insights into the Indian EV landscape. The responsibility for this study was given to the data analytics team at AtliQ Motors, led by Peter Pandey, a seasoned data analyst with extensive experience in the automotive industry.
